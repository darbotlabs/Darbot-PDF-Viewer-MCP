## 🚨 Critical Production Blockers

### Cannot Ship Without:
1. **Extension Icon** (`resources/icons/extension/pdf-icon.png`)
   - Referenced in package.json but missing
   - Marketplace requirement for publication
   - Brand visibility and recognition

2. **Command Icons** (13 SVG files)
   - Commands appear with generic icons in VSCode
   - Poor user experience and discoverability
   - Professional appearance requirement

3. **Basic CSS Architecture**
   - Current inline styling is maintenance nightmare
   - No theme support or responsive design
   - Accessibility and customization limitations
